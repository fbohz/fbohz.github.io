# 🚨 New Site Alert! 🚨

After using Jekyll for such a long time, I wanted to give a much needed facelift. So today I'm happy to announce the launch of my new site:

✅  Modern JS Framework (Gatsby)

✅  Markup used for generating posts

✅  Fast Deployment Through Github Pages

I hope you are enjoying the fast rendering, new UI and colors. I'm loving it! 😍

# P.S. 📨

I know I've been a bit MIA in the past months 😂. 

I decided to dedicate some time on personal projects in areas which I'm passionate such as writing, art and food. 

So here's what I've been working:

- Launched [**Elevarte**](https://medium.com/elevarte/about) ✍🏽! in collaboration with ZDM Writing. We are in baby steps but this will be a space to publish content on a variety of topics to elevate diverse voices.
- Started developing **Catoro** on mobile 📱. Some backbone work has been done. Will be using Firebase and React Native. Really looking to launch this FREE coffee tasting app by Q4 2021.
- New Website for [**ArtesanoSpirit**](http://artesanospirit.com/) project 🎨. Trying to re-imagine my beloved food and art project. More on this to come.
