> Closing-in a year of coding. Looking ahead. 

So I have a calendar reminder for April 7, which was the first day I signed up on Learn.co to prep for my upcoming coding bootcamp, which was starting the month after. 

That was, like *a year ago*? Time flies indeed.

If I was going to guess back then, how these days I was going to be writing about social distancing and promoting [online and virtual networking](https://medium.com/@fbohorqu/stuck-at-home-join-these-tech-business-conferences-events-online-and-free-9e5a5843d80b), probably I would have never guessed that.

So let's take a breath and reflect on what's next for me, or the next chapter on this coding journey.

## So what's next?

1. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
   - It is worth saying that even though the coding bootcamp was a great experience it indeed *missed some important foundations* to build a software engineering career upon. This has to to do with learning about Data Structures and Basic Algorithms. Taking a look about coding interview questions, terms like **Big O**, **Recursion**, or **Dynamic Programming** pop-in. This will not only lay a foundation, but prepare one to learn about software issues in terms of scale, patterns and methodically apply them to day-to-day coding problems.
2. **Advanced JavaScript**
    - I'll want to build on advanced concepts to lay upon my JS fundation. Here I'm thinking digging deep into **closures**, **OOP**, **FP**, **error handling** and ES6+ features. Digging into the inner workings of JavaScript also seems appealing.
3. **Review and Advanced React**
    - Building [Catoro](https://catoro.now.sh/) was an amazing experience that brought a deep interest in React.
    - I'm thinking about implementing a React app without Create React App to practice using Webpack.
    - Gain knowledge and implement react hooks as well as testing
    - Dig into other server implementations, Firebase and GraphQL. Probably for this I'll re-iterate on [Yijing Ball Z](https://yijingballz.herokuapp.com/) to see how it plays with a different backend. Let's see how many Yijing Ball Z can live on Github at the same time. 
4. **Other**
   - React Native, Node.js. Smart Contracts and BlockChain developing. No order in particular.

I'm curious to see whether (or not) how I will follow this path a year from now. Or if there are unexpected coding experiences in the road ahead, well that could be even better, after all I'm a fan of surprises :)
