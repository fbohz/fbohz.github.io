> Closing-in a year of coding.

I have a calendar reminder this April 7. That was the day I signed up on Learn.co to prep for their software engineering coding bootcamp. I actually signed up a month before starting the bootcamp, this as a way to get as much preparation as possible.

That was, like *a year ago*? **Time flies indeed**.

If I was going to guess back then, how these days I was going to be writing about social distancing and promoting [online and virtual networking](https://medium.com/@fbohorqu/stuck-at-home-join-these-tech-business-conferences-events-online-and-free-9e5a5843d80b), probably I would've never guessed that.

Let us then take a deep breath and reflect on what's next, or the next chapter on this coding journey.

## So, what's next?

1. **Continue Learning Algorithms and Data Structures**
   - I began this last month after finishing the bootcamp. **Data Structures and Basic Algorithms** is a priority (*unfortunately* my coding bootcamp did not cover this as part of their 2019-2020 curriculum). 
   - Terms like **Big O**, **Recursion**, or **Dynamic Programming** pop-in in coding interview questions all the time. 
   - This will also prepare me to deal with issues in terms of scale, patterns and methodically apply them to day-to-day coding problems.
2. **Advanced JavaScript**
    - I'll want to expand on advanced concepts to lay on top of my JS fundation
    - Here I'm thinking digging deeper into **closures**, **OOP**, **FP**, **error handling** and ES6+ features. 
    - Learning about the inner workings of JavaScript also seems appealing.
3. **Advanced React**
    - Building [Catoro](https://catoro.now.sh/) was an amazing experience that brought a deep interest in React.
    - I'm thinking about implementing a React app without Create React App to practice using Webpack.
    - Gain knowledge and implement React Hooks as well as testing.
    - Dig into other server implementations, Firebase and GraphQL. Probably for this I'll re-iterate on [Yijing Ball Z](https://yijingballz.herokuapp.com/) to see how it plays with a different backend. Let's see how many Yijing Ball Z can live on Github at the same time. 
4. **Other**
   - React Native, Node.js, Smart Contracts and Blockchain development (in no particular order).

### What *could be* next?

I'm curious to see whether (or not) I will follow this path a year from now. If there are unexpected coding experiences in the road ahead, well that could be even better; after all I'm a fan of surprises ;)
