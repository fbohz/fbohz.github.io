<p>Learning about data structures is an essential part of becoming a more experienced developers. This is the second part of the series, and will be the longest one, buckle down.</p>

<h2 id="stacks--queues">Stacks &amp; Queues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Stack and queues are very similar to linear data structures.</li>
  <li>Only difference is how items are removed.</li>
  <li>Stack and queues have less methods. This could be an advantage as it could limit what can be done.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stacks are like plates</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can only touch the first plate, and go one by one. This is <strong>called last in first out (LIFO)</strong></li>
  <li>These are very good to know the very last value.</li>
  <li>Most programming languages have a stack mindset like LIFO.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other uses</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser history. Undo/Redo. This idea comes from stack.</li>
  <li>Methods are pop() - O(1), push() - O(1) and peek() - O(1). Traverse is not recommended in stack.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Queues</strong></p>

<p>Are like an entrance to a rollercoaster. They have a <strong>first in first out (FIFO)</strong></p>

<p>Uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a wait-list app, could use queues. Restaurant to see if you have table, could use queues. Uber/Lyft uses queues. Printers too.</li>
  <li>Methods are enqueue() - O(1), dequeue() - O(1) and peek() - O(1). Again traversing is not recommended (lookup())</li>
  <li>Dequeue() unlike pop() takes first person, pop() in stack takes last.</li>
  <li><em>Do not build a queue using arrays since its inefficient</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stack-and-queues-implementations">Stack and Queues Implementations</h2>

<p>How can you build stack and queues in JS?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stacks: Arrays or Linked Lists
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Both work very well.</strong></li>
      <li>Think about what are your needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Queues: Arrays or Linked lists.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arrays not recommended</strong>. Because you have to traverse O(n) when you shift and remove.</li>
      <li>Use always Linked Lists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stack--queues-review">Stack / Queues Review</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stacks are like plates. Queues are like waiting lists</li>
  <li>Stacks and Queues are great for removing and inserting. <strong>fast peek</strong></li>
  <li>Data is ordered.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not use Arrays when building queues. Because you have to traverse O(n) when you shift and remove.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Slow lookup for both.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trees">Trees</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Trees have a hierarchical structure.</li>
  <li>Linked lists, arrays are linear. Linked lists are considered a type of tree</li>
  <li>Trees have <strong>only one parent</strong> and it can <strong>leaf notes</strong></li>
  <li>Within trees you can have <strong>sub trees</strong></li>
  <li>Example:
    <ul>
      <li>DOM is a tree data structure. HTML is parent then body is parent with many children.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Facebook comments have a tree DS, with commments of comments etc.</li>
  <li>Abstract syntax tree. Code is broken down by a machine as this.</li>
  <li>There are many tree data structures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each node can only have 0,1,2 nodes. Each node represents a certain state.</li>
  <li>Each child can only have one parent.</li>
  <li>Types of binary trees:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Perfect Binary tree</strong> - nodes are full nothing is missing. They are efficient. Number of nodes double as it goes down. Second property states that bottom levels equal top levels + 1. <strong>So there are some efficiencies here</strong> as O(log N)</li>
      <li><strong>Full binary tree</strong> - the opposite and only meets requirements of binary tree.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="olog-n---reminder">O(log n) - Reminder</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is a certain way to calculate num of nodes of perfect binary trees.
    <ul>
      <li>You calculate 2 to the power of level in question.
        <ul>
          <li>E.g. Level 0: 2^0 = 1. Number of nodes: 1. Lvl 2: 2^2 = 4. etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Based on this formula you can do 2^treeHeight - 1 to know how many total nodes. E.g. 3 Level Tree: 2^3 - 1 = 7 nodes.
        <ul>
          <li>We can simplify as <strong>log notes = treeHeight</strong>. So you by knowing this, you can limit steps by going in one branch.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>So O(log n) is like <strong>divide and conquer</strong>. Choice of next element is one of several. We only choose one not all.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Like looking throgh a phonebook</strong>. You look based upon the names you want. So divide an conquer. Only need to explore subset of tree.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Binary search trees allows us to search efficiently. Google uses this method too.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="binary-search-trees-bst---most-common-tree-ds">Binary Search Trees (BST) - Most common Tree DS.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is BST:
    <ul>
      <li>They are <strong>really good at searching</strong>, comparing things.</li>
      <li>This DS preserves relationships. Like folders, parent folder, subfolder etc., they have unlike Hash Tables.
        <ul>
          <li>e.g.
  101
  /  <br />
  33   105
  / \    / <br />
  9  37  104 144</li>
          <li>Here lookup is very easy you can find by going left of right depending on number.</li>
          <li>insert and delete are also O(log n). For example delete 105, decide which node takes place. Reordering those happens.
            <ul>
              <li>Always traversing and with conditionals saving time to insert, delete.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resource: https://visualgo.net/bn/bst?slide=1</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bst-pros-and-cons">BST Pros and Cons</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Very good performance better than O(n), assuming bST is balanced.</li>
  <li>Ordered and flexible size.</li>
  <li>No O(1) operations, since traversal is required.</li>
  <li>BST is not the fastest, sometimes Arrays out perform them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unbalanced-vs-balances-bst">Unbalanced vs Balances BST</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unbalanced BST</strong>: Where are the nodes are either on the right or left. Becoming more like linked lists. Unbalanced become O(n) for lookup, insert, delete.</li>
  <li><strong>Balanced (PREFERRED)</strong>: How do you balance your trees?
    <ul>
      <li>By algorithms. Programming languages provide libraries and tools for this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="avl-trees--red-black-tree-balancing-binary-search-trees">AVL Trees + Red Black Tree (Balancing Binary Search Trees)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>These trees are used a library and balance trees.</li>
  <li>These balance the trees when finds they are not unbalanced.</li>
  <li>There are resources for you to visualize them:
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="binary-heaps-and-trie">Binary Heaps and Trie</h3>

<p><strong>Heaps</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mostly Binary Heaps.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parent greater than children</strong>.</li>
      <li>Like priority queues, sorting algorightms.</li>
      <li>But left and right can be any value. So lookup as O(n) here.</li>
      <li>They are good at doing comparitve.</li>
      <li><strong>There’s left to right insertion</strong>. You can implement binary heap with arrays.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Priority Queue:
    <ul>
      <li>Different than queues with FIFO.</li>
      <li><strong>Elements with higher priority are server before than lower priority</strong>.</li>
      <li>Example of priority queue:
        <ul>
          <li>Emerency room, airplane boarding.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It gives a sense of structure and order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Memory Heap != Heap Data Structure in JS.</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Searching lookup is slower.</li>
  <li>Gives idea of priority.</li>
  <li>Most of the time insert is fast.</li>
  <li>Methods like find max and fin min are available and very fast.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trie:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Specialized tree used in searching, most often with text.</li>
  <li>In most cases it outperform most data structures, depending what is doing.</li>
  <li>How it works:
    <ul>
      <li>Empty root node.</li>
      <li>Letters are added after.</li>
      <li>They are also called <strong>prefixed tree</strong>, like autocompleted.</li>
      <li>Used for searching words on dictionary, word suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lookup here is fast, you look for length then move. Space complexity also has advantages. Prefixes save space.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trees-conclusion">Trees Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/afiore/arboreal"><strong>Arboreal.js</strong></a> lets you use it and create the tree you want. You won’t be creating trees from scratch.</li>
  <li>You need to understand how they work.</li>
  <li>Try to practice and build one from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>

<p>Last data structure!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graph is a set of values related in pair fashion.
    <ul>
      <li>Like a network</li>
      <li>Each item is called a node or vertex.</li>
      <li>Nodes are connected with edges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>They model real work relationships. Kind of like internet works.</li>
  <li>To represent roads, friends. Google maps uses graphs to determine shortest map.</li>
  <li><strong>Linked lists, trees are a type of graphs!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types-of-graphs">Types of Graphs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Directed vs Undirected
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Directed</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>One way street.</li>
          <li>Twitter is more directed if they follow me i don’t necessarily follow them</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Undirected</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Two way street.</li>
          <li>Facebook is undirected a friend can be connected to another</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unweighted and Weighted
    <ul>
      <li>Weighted graphs has information in the edges / connections too.
        <ul>
          <li>Google Maps uses weighted graphs. Like fastes way in 1-6.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cyclic vs Acyclic
    <ul>
      <li>If vertices are connected in a cycle are cyclic.
        <ul>
          <li>Cyclic are common in weighted because there’s a way to go back.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Example: https://internet-map.net/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Directed Acyclic Graph is common in projects such as IOTA a blockchain project.
    <ul>
      <li>Many trees can also create this data structure.</li>
      <li>There are some online graphs you can see and check to test your knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
