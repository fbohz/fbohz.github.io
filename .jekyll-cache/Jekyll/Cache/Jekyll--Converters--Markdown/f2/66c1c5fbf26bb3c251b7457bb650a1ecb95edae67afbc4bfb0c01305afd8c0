  <p>Do we choose what we do? or is it the other way around?</p>

<p>My interest in computer programming started when I was fresh out of college. Back then, a process improvement opportunity came up and it volunteer myself in a project involving implementing a Moodle Platform as part of a curriculum development for a leadership program. I winged this project by looking at forums for help regarding every single aspect of its implementation, from configuration of site to hosting, and to SMPT configuration. I even got the opportunity to break the site once, while doing an update, and then probably a couple of times more while trying to make changes, upgrades or modifications to it.</p>

<p>What actually happened from that project is that it brought to me my first experience with technology. As I was reading online about eLearning I came accross MOOCs and then somehow stumbled onto an edX course on Computer Programming. That was my first experience and this course proved very difficult, so I actually never got to finish it. However, a spark has been born and since then Iâ€™ve been interested in one way or another in information systems, coding and its business applications.</p>

<p><strong><em>So why did I decide to learn coding?</em></strong> Software development is a little bit like education. You are <em>â€˜teachingâ€™</em> the computer to do certain things, somehow computers if given the correct instructions can do amazing things and makes things easier. Coding is a powerful tool to have and it is indeed an empowering skill to develop. Being creative, solving problems and makes things better is a passion for me, that is why I decided to learn software development or maybe the other way around.</p>
