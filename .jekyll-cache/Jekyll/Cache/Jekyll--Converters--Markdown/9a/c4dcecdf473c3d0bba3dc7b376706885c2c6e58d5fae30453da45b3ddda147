  <p>Closing-in a year of coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a calendar reminder in April 7. That was the day I signed up on Learn.co to prep for their software engineering coding bootcamp. I actually signed up a month before starting the bootcamp, this as a way to get as much preparation as possible.</p>

<p>That was, like <em>a year ago</em>? <strong>Time flies indeed</strong>.</p>

<p>If I was going to guess back then, how these days I was going to be writing about social distancing and promoting <a href="https://medium.com/@fbohorqu/stuck-at-home-join-these-tech-business-conferences-events-online-and-free-9e5a5843d80b">online and virtual networking</a>, probably I never would’ve guessed that.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deep breath and reflect on what’s next, like the next chapter, of this coding journey.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Continue Learning Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I began learning this last month after finishing the bootcamp. <strong>Data Structures and Basic Algorithms</strong> is a priority since <em>unfortunately</em> my coding bootcamp did not cover this as part of their 2019-2020 curriculum.</li>
      <li>Terms like <strong>Big O</strong>, <strong>Recursion</strong>, or <strong>Dynamic Programming</strong> pop-in in coding interview questions all the time.</li>
      <li>This will also prepare me to deal with issues in terms of scale, patterns and methodically apply them to day-to-day coding problems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Advanced JavaScript</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I’ll want to expand on advanced concepts to lay on top of my JS fundation</li>
      <li>Here I’m thinking digging deeper into <strong>closures</strong>, <strong>OOP</strong>, <strong>FP</strong>, <strong>error handling</strong> and ES6+ features.</li>
      <li>Learning about the inner workings of JavaScript also seems appealing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Advanced React</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Building <a href="https://catoro.now.sh/"><strong>Catoro</strong></a> was an amazing experience that brought a deep interest in React.</li>
      <li>I’m thinking about implementing a React app without Create React App to practice using Webpack.</li>
      <li>Gain knowledge and implement React Hooks as well as testing.</li>
      <li>Dig into other server implementations, Firebase and GraphQL. Probably for this I’ll re-iterate on <a href="https://yijingballz.herokuapp.com/"><strong>Yijing Ball Z</strong></a> to see how it plays with a different backend. Let’s see how many Yijing Ball Z’s can live on Github at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Other</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>React Native, Node.js, Smart Contracts and Blockchain development (in no particular order).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-could-be-next">What <em>could be</em> next?</h3>

<p>I’m curious to see whether (or not) I will follow this path a year from now. If there are unexpected coding experiences in the road ahead, well that could be even better. After all, I’m a big fan of surprises ;)</p>
