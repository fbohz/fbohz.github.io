<p>I am a passionate software engineer and social entrepreneur. I am proud of my beginnings as a youth developer with inner-city kids then through education within the halls of congress and now in software engineering. </br></br>

As a software engineer with a focus on React and JavaScript, I've built a robust portfolio including a professional coffee cupping app. I've also built custom library projects that have been used widely by the developer community.</br></br>

As a social entrepreneur I have co-launched different projects in areas such as health (MomBox), sustainability (PowerToThePeople), specialty food through art (<a href="https://artesanospirit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtesanoSpirit</a>) and performing arts. Many of such ventures have been awarded in business competitions.</p>
