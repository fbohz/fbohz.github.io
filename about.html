<p>I am a passionate Flatiron School software engineer and social entrepreneur. I am proud of my beginnings as a youth developer with inner-city kids through then through education within the halls of congress and now in software engineering. </br>

As a software engineer with a focus on React and Rails, I've built a robust portfolio including a professional coffee cupping app (Catoro.now.sh). I've also built custom projects library projects that have been used widely by the developer community (https://rubygems.org/gems/coingecko).</br>

As a social entrepreneur I have co-launched different projects in areas such as health (MomBox), sustainability (PowerToThePeople), specialty food through art (ArtesanoSpirit) and performing arts. Many of such ventures have been awarded in business competitions.</p>
