# Title Here?

Companies like Facebook, Google and the like are famous for their whiteboard challenges. I decided to take a chance at the classic Facebook question delineated on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UWDyJq8jZg&t=7s).

**The Question**

Given a list of people with their birth and death YEARS, find the year with the highest population.

**The Solution**

I implemented a class-based approach. If you can't see the code below just access it [here](https://repl.it/@fbohz/CodingInterviewQsPractice#index.js).

**Feedback / Thoughts**

Just just me a message at <a href="mailto:misguidedapps@gmail.com">misguidedapps@gmail.com</a> for any feedback/thoughts about it!
